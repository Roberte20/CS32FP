# CS32FP
Computer Science 32 Final Project

For my final project, I am planning to do work that will prepare me for my PE summer internship. While the  use case isn't specifically addressing a problem, working through these tasks will provide me with the necessary introductions to certains libraries and processes. Nonethless I plan to: 

- Read through spreadsheeets with various libraries like pandas (also win32coms, xlwings, and openpyxl). Just basic spreadsheet navigation
- Learning and applying the pandas libary (learning what is possible with this library and incorporating it into my spreadsheet analysis)

Since, I do not have a well thought out use of these libraries, a project I thought of is to: 
- Ready multiple similar structured spreadsheets using python/pandas combining them into a single dataframe
- Performing some calculations and returning the outputs to another spreadsheet 

An additional step, but I only plan to do it if the above portions are not challenging enough: 
- Get a basic understanding of scikit-learn since it deals with some machine learning bits that can prove helpful for my summmer.
