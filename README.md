# CS32FP
Computer Science 32 Final Project

For my final project, I am planning to do work that will prepare me for my PE summer internship. While the  use case isn't specifically addressing a problem, working through these tasks will provide me with the necessary introductions to certains libraries and processes. Nonethless I plan to: 

- Read through spreadsheeets with various libraries like pandas (also win32coms, xlwings, and openpyxl). Just basic spreadsheet navigation
- Learning and applying the pandas libary (learning what is possible with this library and incorporating it into my spreadsheet analysis)

Since, I do not have a well thought out use of these libraries, a project I thought of is to: 
- Ready multiple similar structured spreadsheets using python/pandas combining them into a single dataframe
- Performing some calculations and returning the outputs to another spreadsheet 

An additional step, but I only plan to do it if the above portions are not challenging enough: 
- Get a basic understanding of scikit-learn since it deals with some machine learning bits that can prove helpful for my summmer. 

# FP Design 4/10 Update

After working on the FP design assignment, I am able to slightly narrow my project scope and enhance the topic to be of a more deliverable nature. Firstly, I skimmed over the basic documentation of pandas. After implementing 'starter code' for pandas, I was able to see how to do some basic data manipulation and how to parse some information. However, I wasn't able to pull data from excel. Secondly, I did more research on scikit-learn. After doing all of this, I feel that my project can pull data from a number of UK government websites (such as gilt rates or other nationally set relevant variables) and formatting them onto a spreadsheet. Following this transfer of data, I can run some regressions and analysis to view the trends of this data.  

I would mainly be dealing with extracting data from websites and excel and being able to smoothly arrange the data. 

# Final Project Notes 

Pulling of data, some data manipulation. 
Potential user input 

What are my questions and where can I pull the data from? 
What is the YOY change and avg. salary in the UK.

Small data set vs. large data set (like in the PSETs) 

Don't think that project needs to be perfect, but using the skills 

Next Step: What is a good deliverable (some form of data manipulation)

        - Pick one of the categories and go from there (doesn't need to be as dynamic)

API and what it represents, how I pulled information and now I'm able to answer the question or how I joined the datasets together. 

** Never finished type of project, I would continue developing later **
